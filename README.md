# HTML and CSS - Module 1

## Task 2

In this lesson assignment we're going to be taking off from the end of lesson task 1.1 where we created the HTML for the index.html page.

### Brief

In this lesson task you are going to create the other HTML files for the project, link them together, as well as linking to the images in the HTML.

By the end of this lesson task, you should have created:
- guitars.html with the list of guitars
- contact.html with just a single h1 (we'll add the form later)
- adirondack-red.html with the information about the Adirondack Red (we're just adding one version of the product for now). Place adironrdack-red.html into a folder called 'guitars'.

While building the HTML pages add working links to connect the pages together, as well as linking to the images for the page.

When you have finished building the pages, switch across to the 'answers' branch to see how you could have completed the lesson task.
